Is an Inter-faculty wide Quantum Computing Event called IBM Fall Fest, scheduled to begin on **20th November, 2024.**

The program is an initiative of IBM, a renown tech giant,  aimed at introducing students to the emerging field of quantum computing, which leverages quantum mechanics for advanced computation, offering new capabilities in areas like cryptography and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

IBM nominates two Fall Fest participants from Nigeria each year for its Quantum Computing Hackathon in Abu Dhabi. For two successive editions/years - 2023 and 2024 - students of University of Uyo made the pick. So far, University of Uyo is only behind University of Lagos as far as IBM Quantum Computing events are concerned in Nigeria. The exposure it promises our students is massive. This event is open not only to the Faculty of Engineering but also  Faculties of Science and Computing.
